# Peer-to-Peer Messaging Website Prototype

Welcome to the Peer-to-Peer Messaging Website Prototype! This project allows users to connect with each other via a peer-to-peer network and exchange messages.

## Features

- **Peer Connection**: Users can share their connection IDs to establish direct connections with others.
- **Messaging**: Once connected, users can send and receive messages in real-time.
- **Multi-Peer Support**: Supports communication between multiple peers simultaneously.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For client-side scripting and peer connection handling.
- **HTML/CSS**: Front-end structure and styling.
- **PeerJS**: Simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer data, audio, and video calls. It provides a server and a JavaScript library that abstracts the complexities of WebRTC peer-to-peer connections. PeerJS facilitates peer discovery, signaling, and negotiation, allowing devices to connect directly to each other (peer-to-peer) via the browser.

## Usage

No setup required! Simply visit [Peer-to-Peer Messaging Website](https://lukas-petervary.github.io/p2p-connect/) to use the application.

1. **Connecting**:
    - Share your connection ID (generated by the website) with others or input someone else's ID to connect.

2. **Messaging**:
    - Once connected, you can send messages to the connected peers.
    - All connected peers will receive the messages instantly.
